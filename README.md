# Angular Chat
A single page web application implemented in HTML5, CSS, AngularJS 1.4.7, and using Firebase 2.2.4 as a back-end database for storing information about rooms, users, and chats. The app was built as a project as part of Bloc's [Frontend Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) coding bootcamp.

The app allows multiple users to simultaneously chat and manage chat rooms in realtime. For more information and demo see my [website](http://gregbabb.com/projects/2-bloc-chat.html).

## Starting the app
Angular Chat runs with a starter application using the `grunt` build tool and `npm`. The easiest way to run the app is to download and install these dependencies. More information can be found in the [starter application](https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter) repository.

Using the app is straightfoward&mdash;just sign in with a user name, select a room, and chat away.
